You may notice you see things like local upper = script.Parent.Parent. This just means define (local) upper. Upper will be equal to script.Parent.Parent.
Script.Parent.Parent just means the script's Parent's Parent. In code you also may see upper.Transparency = 1. This is just a shorthand of saying;
script.Parent.Parent.Transparency = 1
