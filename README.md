# Kato_County
Kato County is a Roblox RP game. In this repository, all the game files (code) is available including all the code.

_Shortcuts_

Usually, in the beginning of these files you will see something like: local upper = script.Parent.Parent or something like that. You will also see upper.transparency = 1 or something like that. This is saying, define (local) a variable named upper. That will be equal to script.Parent.Parent. Now I can use that in my code, instead of typing a long phrase (being script.Parent.Parent in this case), we only have to type in the phrase "upper".
